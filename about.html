  <h1>About Team HBV</h1>
  <p><strong>Team HBV</strong> is a collegiate and high school outreach initiative of the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/liver/home/youth.html" target="_blank">Asian Liver Center at Stanford University</a>. Its mission is to increase awareness of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), promote vaccination, and reduce stigma surrounding liver disease, particularly in Asian and Pacific Islander communities.</p>

  <h2>The Jade Ribbon Campaign</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Jade Ribbon Campaign</strong> is the global awareness movement founded by the Asian Liver Center. It symbolizes the fight against Hepatitis B and liver cancer, spreading knowledge about prevention, testing, and treatment. The jade ribbon represents both the liver’s renewal and the cultural significance of jade as a symbol of health and longevity in many Asian cultures.</p>

  <h2>What is Hepatitis B?</h2>
  <p><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is a viral infection that affects the liver and can lead to serious health issues such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. It is transmitted through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids, but it is preventable through vaccination. Awareness and early testing are key to eliminating HBV as a global health threat.</p>
